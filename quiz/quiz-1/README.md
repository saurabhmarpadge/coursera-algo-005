# Problem Set 1

## Question 5

Arrange the following functions in increasing order of growth rate (with g(n) following f(n) in your list if and only if f(n)=O(g(n))).

a. (n ^ 2) * log(n)
b. 2 ^ n
c. 2 ^ (n ^ 2)
d. n ^ log(n)
e. n ^ 2

e a d b c

Write your 5-letter answer, i.e., the sequence in lower case letters in the space provided. For example, if you feel that the answer is a->b->c->d->e (from smallest to largest), then type abcde in the space provided without any spaces before / after / in between the string. You can assume that all logarithms are base 2 (though it actually doesn't matter). WARNING: this question has multiple versions, you might see different ones on different attempts!
